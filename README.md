✨ What Was Built Using Vercel v0 (5–10 lines)

Used Vercel v0 to auto-generate the initial layout structure for the Hero section.

Generated starting versions of Feature cards and Pricing cards using v0 component prompts.

Bootstraped the base responsive grid using v0 suggestions.

Took v0-generated component skeletons and refined the UI, improving spacing and styling manually.

Used Vercel v0 to create quick mock UI blocks for the hero illustration.

Leveraged v0 to quickly scaffold the CTA section layout.

Combined v0-generated layouts with hand-crafted Tailwind CSS to produce a polished and professional UI.
